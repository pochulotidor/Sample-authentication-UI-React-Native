# Sample-authentication-UI-React-NativeI-
An example of authentication UI in react native where you can navigate between screens (ex. login screen, create new account, forgot password) with the use of react navigation(stack navigation is used to be exact) and custom buttons and textInputs.

This is just a simple illustration on how you can build an authentication UI in react-native, this repository is intended for those individuals who is planning or just starting to learn react native.

Note: textInputs and buttons doesn't hold any states yet because again, this is just a simple  example on how to build or structure an authentication UI uing react-native. Maybe in the future we can update this repo to add more functionalities.
